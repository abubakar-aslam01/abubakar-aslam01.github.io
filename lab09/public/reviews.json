    "review_content": "The Dell XPS 13 is perfect! The battery life is phenomenal for all-day coding, and the display is gorgeous for media. The only minor drawback is the lack of traditional USB-A ports, but a dongle solves that easily. Highly recommend for professionals."

    "review_content": "Got the HP OMEN gaming laptop, and it's a beast! Runs all the newest AAA games at high settings with a silky-smooth frame rate. It does get quite hot and the fans are loud under heavy load, but that's expected for this level of performance. Great value for a gaming machine."
